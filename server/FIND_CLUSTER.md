# How to Find Your MongoDB Atlas Cluster Address

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Log into MongoDB Atlas
- Go to https://cloud.mongodb.com/
- Sign in with your account

### 2. Navigate to Your Cluster
- You should see your cluster on the main dashboard
- It will show as something like "Cluster0" or "MyCluster"

### 3. Click "Connect"
- Click the **"Connect"** button on your cluster card

### 4. Choose "Connect your application"
- Select **"Connect your application"** (not "Connect with MongoDB Compass" or "Connect with MongoDB Shell")

### 5. Copy the Connection String
You'll see a connection string that looks like this:

```
mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.abc123.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

### 6. Find Your Cluster Address
The cluster address is the part between `@` and `.mongodb.net`:

- **Example:** `cluster0.abc123` ← This is your cluster address
- **Full example:** `mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster0.abc123.mongodb.net/...`

### 7. Build Your Complete Connection String

Replace the placeholders:
- `<username>` → Your database username
- `<password>` → Your database password
- Add `/strawbeary` before the `?` to specify the database name

**Final format:**
```
mongodb+srv://yourusername:yourpassword@cluster0.abc123.mongodb.net/strawbeary?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

### Visual Guide:

```
mongodb+srv://[USERNAME]:[PASSWORD]@[CLUSTER_ADDRESS].mongodb.net/[DATABASE]?retryWrites=true&w=majority
                            ↑
                    This is your cluster address
                    (e.g., cluster0.abc123)
```

### Common Cluster Names:
- `cluster0.xxxxx` (most common)
- `cluster1.xxxxx`
- `mycluster.xxxxx`
- Or whatever you named it

The `xxxxx` part is unique to your cluster - it's automatically generated by MongoDB Atlas.
